- *mate killers*
- *replace by depth scheme in transposition table*
- *smarter depth reduction and more accurate conditions defining late moves*
- *experiment with null move pruning*
- *try to consider castle factor in static evaluation*
- *try gradual widening on re-searches in aspiration window search*
- *try extended futility pruning and other futility methods*
- *improve basic time management system*
