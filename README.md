### TODO in the future:

- *set prev_move as last performed move in [fen pos moves ...] token*
- *(?) smarter MVV/LVA lookup table values*
- *mate killers*
- *replace by depth scheme in main tt*
- *more accurate conditions defining late moves*
- *smarter phase checking in null move pruning*
- *apply gradual widening on re-searches in aspiration window search*
- *(?) apply razoring*
- *wise endgame evaluation*
